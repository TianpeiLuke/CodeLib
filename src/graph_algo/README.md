# Graph-based Algorithms
This subsection implements a set of graph-based algorithms. It consists of three sub-categories: 

1. Graph Construct
   This includes graph load algorithms and construction of various graph representations. The main graph representation uses an adjacency list. An edge list representation is also available. 

2. Graph Search Algorithm
   1) Depth-First-Search and Breadth-First-Search
