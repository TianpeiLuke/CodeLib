# Graph-based Algorithms
This subsection implements a set of graph-based algorithms. It consists of three sub-categories: 

## Graph Construct\\
   This includes graph load algorithms and construction of various _graph representations_.\\ 
   The main graph representation uses an __adjacency list__. An __edge list__ representation is also available. 

## Graph Search Algorithms\\
   1. __Depth-First-Search (DFS)__ and __Breadth-First-Search (BFS)__\\
      The basic traversal and searching algorithm. Implemented via recursion and backtracking using stack (DFS) and queue (BFS). 
  
   2. Layer-wise searching \\


## Graph Topology Algorithms\\
   1. __Strong Connected Components (directed graph)__ and __Connected Components (undirected graph)__ \\
      
      Using Karger's two-pass DFS implementation for __SCC__ 
      Using
