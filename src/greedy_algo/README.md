# Greedy Algorithm
This section involves implementation of several greedy algorithms.

## Characteristics of greedy algorithm

  1. Optimal substructure


  2. Greedy-choice property


  3. Compare with dynamic programming 



## Examples

  1. __Interval selection__ (__activities selection, room booking etc.__)


  2. __Dijkstra's single-source-shortest-path algorithm__


  3. __hiriearchical clustering, Huffman's coding__
