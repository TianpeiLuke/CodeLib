# Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This subsection implements various of divide and conquer algorithms.

## Characteristics of problem

  1. __Repeating structure__

  The original problem can be divided into several problems. Each problem has exactly the same structure (i.e. seen as the same problem) but with smaller size.

  2. __Non-sharing resources (independent)__

  Each of the subproblem does __not share resources__ (i.e. input, intermedia results etc.).
