# Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This subsection implements various of divide and conquer algorithms.

## Characteristics of divide-and-conquer problems

  1. __Repeating structure__

  The original problem can be divided into several smaller problems. Each sub-problem has exactly the same structure (i.e. seen as the same problem) but with smaller size of state space (including input data, or intermediate results).

  2. __Non-sharing resources (independent subproblems)__

  Each of the subproblem does __not share resources__ (i.e. states for each subproblem such as the input, intermedia results etc.).
