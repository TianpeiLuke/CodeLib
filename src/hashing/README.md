# Hashing table related algorithms
This subsection involves problems that can be implemented efficiently using additional space with hash table.

## Examples

 1. __Two Sum__

    Given an array of integers, find two integers that sum equal to a given number. Naive implementation requires O(n^2) time complexity. With a hash table, it requires only O(n) time complexity.

    Try 1,000,000 points, 

    `../../bin/hashing/test_twoSum`

 2. __Binary Tree vertical ordering__



 3. __Implementation of Graph adjacency list representation__

    Since the most commonly used operation in adjacency list representation is searching (i.e. access, insertion, deletion),  it make sense to reduce to time complexity as O(1).
