# Hashing table related algorithms
This subsection involves problems that can be implemented efficiently using additional space with hash table.

## Examples

 1. Two Sum

    Given an array of integers, find two integers that sum equal to a given number. Naive implementation requires $O(n^2)$ time complexity. With a hash table, it requires only O(n) time complexity.


 2. Binary Tree vertical ordering
